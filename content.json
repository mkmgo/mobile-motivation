'Turn right this instant!' and criticizing your performance: 'You're driving too slowly!' or 'You're going much too fast! <br><b>You are still the bus driver and only you can decide where the bus goes. So it's not about silencing these thoughts somehow, but simply accepting that you have these passengers, but that you don't have to do what they demand all the time.",

    "tile_content": "To avoid brooding, which is a form of negative and repetitive thinking (rumination), you can use distraction, mindfulness, and cognitive-behavioral techniques. These exercises help break the cycle of unproductive thoughts and shift your focus toward the present. \nMindfulness and awareness\nAcknowledge and label thoughts. When you notice yourself starting to brood, simply label the thought without judgment. For example, say to yourself, \"That's a 'worry' thought,\" or \"I'm ruminating again.\" This creates distance between you and your thoughts, reminding you that they are just mental events, not facts.\nPractice \"Leaves on a Stream.\" Visualize yourself sitting by a stream and placing each negative or repetitive thought on a leaf floating by. Watch it float away without chasing it. This exercise teaches you to observe your thoughts without getting caught up in them.\nFocus on your senses. Engage your five senses to ground yourself in the present moment. Name five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This technique is especially useful during moments of intense worry.\nPractice mindful breathing. Pay close attention to the sensation of your breath as you inhale and exhale. When your mind starts to wander, gently redirect your focus back to your breathing. \nDistraction and behavioral activation\nEngage in active hobbies. When you feel yourself starting to brood, redirect your attention toward an activity you enjoy that requires focus, such as reading, playing an instrument, or doing a puzzle.\nClean or organize. Physical activity like cleaning a drawer or tidying up a room can be a productive way to disrupt the thought cycle.\nGet outdoors. Spending time in nature, whether for a walk in a park or a hike on a trail, has been shown to reduce rumination and improve mood.\nTalk to a friend. Confiding in a supportive, level-headed friend or family member can provide perspective and interrupt the thought loop. Be sure to choose someone who will help you problem-solve rather than join you in the rumination. \nCognitive restructuring\nSchedule a \"worry time.\" Instead of trying to stop worrying entirely, set aside a specific 15- to 20-minute period each day to address your concerns. If a worry pops up outside this time, remind yourself, \"I'll think about this later,\" and refocus on what you are doing. This puts you in control of the thought, rather than the other way around.\nChallenge negative thoughts. Question the validity of your negative thoughts by asking yourself:\nIs this thought 100% true?\nWhat is the evidence for or against this thought?\nWhat would I tell a friend in a similar situation?\nMake an action plan. If a worry is based on a real, solvable problem, create a step-by-step plan. For example, if you are worried about an upcoming project, break down the project into smaller, manageable steps and focus on taking the first one. This shifts your brain from passive dwelling to active problem-solving.\nJournal your thoughts. Writing down your worries can help you process them, identify recurring patterns, and gain perspective. Instead of endlessly replaying them in your head, you can get them out on paper.",
