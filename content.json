They clamor for your attention, yelling directions like, 'No, turn left now!' 'Turn right this instant!' and criticizing your performance: 'You're driving too slowly!' or 'You're going much too fast! <br><b>You are still the bus driver and only you can decide where the bus goes. So it's not about silencing these thoughts somehow, but simply accepting that you have these passengers, but that you don't have to do what they demand all the time.",
