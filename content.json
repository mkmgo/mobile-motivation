They clamor for your attention, yelling directions like, 'No, turn left now!' 'Turn right this instant!' and criticizing your performance: 'You're driving too slowly!' or 'You're going much too fast! <br><b>You are still the bus driver and only you can decide where the bus goes. So it's not about silencing these thoughts somehow, but simply accepting that you have these passengers, but that you don't have to do what they demand all the time.",

    "tile_content": "To avoid brooding, which is a form of negative and repetitive thinking (rumination), you can use distraction, mindfulness, and cognitive-behavioral techniques. These exercises help break the cycle of unproductive thoughts and shift your focus toward the present. \n<br>\n<strong>Mindfulness and awareness</strong><br>\n<blockquote>Acknowledge and label thoughts. When you notice yourself starting to brood, simply label the thought without judgment. For example, say to yourself, \"That's a 'worry' thought,\" or \"I'm ruminating again.\" This creates distance between you and your thoughts, reminding you that they are just mental events, not facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Practice \"Leaves on a Stream.\" Visualize yourself sitting by a stream and placing each negative or repetitive thought on a leaf floating by. Watch it float away without chasing it. This exercise teaches you to observe your thoughts without getting caught up in them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Focus on your senses. Engage your five senses to ground yourself in the present moment. Name five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This technique is especially useful during moments of intense worry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Focus on your senses. Engage your five senses to ground yourself in the present moment.

Pay close attention to the sensation of your breath as you inhale and exhale. When your mind starts to wander, gently redirect your focus back to your breathing.</blockquote>",
